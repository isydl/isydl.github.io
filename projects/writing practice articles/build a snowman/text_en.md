How to Make the Perfect Snowman
When winter comes with heavy snow, it’s time to get out there and build a snowman! It’s simple to roll up three snowballs: one large, one medium, and one small. Stack them up with the biggest on bottom and the smallest on top for the head. Then let your creative side run wild by decorating the snowman with a face, clothing, arms, and any accessories that you want!

How to Build a Snowman: Quick Steps
Make a snowball and roll it on the ground until it's large enough to be the base of your snowman. Make a second, smaller snowball and stack it on the base to create the midsection. Make a third, even smaller snowball and stack it on midsection to create the head. Use branches to give your snowman arms, and use rocks for the eyes and a carrot as the nose.

Moist snow that sticks together works best for making a snowman.
Moist snow that sticks together works best for making a snowman. Go out to the snow and scoop some up between both of your hands. Press it together, and if it forms into a ball, you’ll be able to make a snowman. If your snow is too fluffy or powdery, or if the snow is too slushy, you will not be able to make a snowman.[1]
If the snowball falls apart, it’s no good for making a snowman.
Making the snowman close to a building also provides shade for some of the day. Shade can make your snowman last longer because it isn’t sitting out in the sun all day.

Start forming the base of your snowman in your hands.
Start forming the base of your snowman in your hands. Scoop up a handful of snow with both hands. Pack it together into a round shape. Add snow to the ball in your hands until it is about 1 foot (30 cm) in diameter, or until it gets too heavy.
Make sure you are wearing warm waterproof gloves, or else your hands will start to hurt from handling the snow.

Snow will stick to the ball and make a large sturdy base.
Snow will stick to the ball and make a large sturdy base. Set the snowball on the ground and begin rolling it forward. Change the direction you’re rolling the ball frequently to avoid making it into a cylinder. Keep rolling until the ball is about 3 feet (90 cm) wide.[2]
Pat your snowball together every so often to keep excess snow from falling off.
Stop rolling the snowball in the spot where you want to build your snowman. Make sure you start somewhere near that spot, and roll the ball so that you end up there.
It often works well to roll the ball in a large spiral, but take note that this will leave an obvious pattern in the snow.

Make a second smaller snowball for the middle section.

The middle section becomes the snowman’s body.
The middle section becomes the snowman’s body. Scoop up some snow in both hands and pack it into a tight ball. Add more snow until the ball is too heavy to carry. Put it on the ground and roll it around as you did for the bottom section. This time, stop when the ball reaches about 2 feet (61 cm) in diameter.[3]
Roll the snowball in a circle around the bottom section, or in a straight line away from it and back to it. This way when you finish the ball you won’t have to carry it a long way to the bottom section.

Stack the snowballs so they’re perfectly balanced.
Stack the snowballs so they’re perfectly balanced. Depending on how big you are, have someone help you lift the large ball. Bend your knees and be sure to stand up with your legs rather than your back. Pick it up and gently set it on the bottom section. Make sure that it sits right in the center of the bottom ball.
It helps if you flatten the top side of the bottom ball and flatten the bottom side of the middle ball. This helps the middle section sit firmly on the bottom section.
If you want to make a shorter snowman, then stop after adding the second snowball and use it as the head.

Finish your snowman with the final snowball.
Finish your snowman with the final snowball. Scoop up one last ball of snow for the head. Pack it with your hands until it is about 1 foot (30 cm) in diameter. You should be able to make the head without rolling it, but it’s okay to roll it if you want to make it a little bigger. When you finish, carefully place it on top of the snowman’s body.

Extra snow helps the snowballs stick together better.
Extra snow helps the snowballs stick together better. Once the three sections are in place, scoop up more snow and pack it between each section. This will give the snowman a uniform look from top to bottom rather than looking like three snowballs piled on top of each other.
Be careful not to push too hard when you’re packing in the extra snow, or else your snowman may tip over.

A carrot nose gives your snowman its iconic look.
A carrot nose gives your snowman its iconic look. Grab a long raw carrot and place it in the middle of the top snowball for its nose. Make sure you leave room above it for eyes and below it for a mouth.
Making the snowman your own is all about creativity. If you don’t have a carrot, then use another long vegetable, a stick, or a button.

Eyes will help make your snowman pop.
Eyes will help make your snowman pop. Any round object will work for the eyes. Place whatever you’re using for the eyes above the carrot and space them evenly to the right and the left. Push them into the head, and twist them in a circle so that they stick in the snow.
Other options to use for eyes are yellow ping-pong balls, blue rubber bouncy balls, or large green plastic gems.
If you want a simple snowman, eyes and a nose are all you need if you want to stop or if you’re getting too cold outside.

A big smile on your snowman will help spread the holiday cheer.
A big smile on your snowman will help spread the holiday cheer. Use the same objects you used for the eyes, or mix it up with other round objects. Place the mouth under the nose, but not too close to the middle section.
Alternatively, cut a mouth out of felt, stick some fake plastic teeth in the face, or bend a piece of rubber tubing into a smile.

Give your snowman arms to complete its body.
Give your snowman arms to complete its body. Find a couple of sticks that are about 1 in (2.5 cm) or less wide and around 3 feet (90 cm) long. Push the sticks into the middle section on each side of the snowman. Position the sticks so they are angled up or down depending on what look you like best.
Put a shirt or coat around the body of the snowman before you stick in the arms if you want it to look more realistic.
Alternatively, use old broom sticks, golf clubs, or fake skeleton arms for a more unique look!

Finish your snowman’s look with a few pieces of clothing. Any hat or scarf will do, so let your creativity shine! Grab an old ball cap, cowboy hat, fedora, or top hat for the snowman’s head. Then, wrap a colorful scarf around its neck.
Use old stuff that you don’t mind possibly ruining.
Add a tie, sunglasses, or any other accessories to make the snowman stand out from the rest.
